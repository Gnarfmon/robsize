Using a kernel with high theoretical throughput to investigate wether frontend limitations become visible on Ice Lake (Server) (exact name Intel Xeon Platinum 8360Y)  architecture.
NI chosen to result in workingset size approximatley 3/4 of L1-instruction cache size(32KiB https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/microarchitectures/ice_lake_(server) and "lscpu" command ).
Test is run with  "srun --cpu-freq=2400000-2400000:performance ./frontendThroughputTest 800 2400000" on singlenode partition on fritz.
Benchmark files: ./frontendThroughoutTest*/.cpp/.s
