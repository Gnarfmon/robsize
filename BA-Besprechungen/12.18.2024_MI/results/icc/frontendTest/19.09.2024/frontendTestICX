Using a kernel with high theoretical throughput to investigate wether frontend limitations become visible on Ice Lake Server architecture.
NI chosen to result in workingset size approximatley 3/4 of L1-instruction cache size(32KiB https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/intel/microarchitectures/ice_lake_(server) ).
Potential intel tool for self verification: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057727/processors.html.
Test is run with  "srun --cpu-freq=2400000-2400000:performance ./frontendThroughputTest 800 2400000" on singlenode partition on fritz.
Benchmark files: ./frontendThroughoutTest*/.cpp/.s
